# 531WorkoutCalculator
A web application that helps me calculate a 5, 3, 1 workout rotation

### Description
This web application allows a user to enter a one rep max weight value and the application will output a 4 week rotation with fixed sets, reps, 
percentages, and calculated weights. The fixed sets, reps, and percentages are done because of *my* personal 5, 3, 1 workout routine.
